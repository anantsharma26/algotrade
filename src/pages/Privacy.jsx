          <h4>Preamble</h4>
          <p>
            We at Algoo Trading respect and protect the privacy of visitors to
            our websites and our customers. This Privacy Policy describes our
            information handling practices when you access our services (as
            described and governed by our Terms of Use and referred to
            collectively hereinafter as "Services"). Please take a moment to
            read this Privacy Policy carefully. If you have any questions about
            this Policy, please submit them to support@Algoo Trading.org. We may
            modify this Privacy Policy from time to time and will notify you by
            email (sent to the email address specified in your account) and via
            a notice on our Services prior to the change becoming effective, or
            as otherwise required by law.
          </p>
          <h4>1. ACCEPTANCE OF THIS PRIVACY POLICY</h4>
          <p>
            By accessing and using our Services, you signify acceptance to the
            terms of this Privacy Policy. Where we require your consent to
            process your personal information, we will ask for your consent to
            the collection, use, and disclosure of your personal information as
            described further below. We may provide additional "just-in-time"
            disclosures or information about the data processing practices of
            specific Services. These notices may supplement or clarify our
            privacy practices or may provide you with additional choices about
            how we process your data. If you do not agree with or you are not
            comfortable with any aspect of this Privacy Policy, you should
            immediately discontinue access or use of our Services.
          </p>
          <h4>2. THE PERSONAL INFORMATION WE COLLECT</h4>
          <p>
            Personal information is typically data that identifies an individual
            or relates to an identifiable individual. This includes information
            you provide to us, information which is collected about you
            automatically, and information collected during the course of the
            provision of the Services, including through the Know Your Customer
            (KYC) process. The definition of personal information depends on the
            applicable law based on your physical location. Only the definition
            that applies to your physical location will apply to you under this
            Privacy Policy. We may collect the following types of information
            from you: - Personal Identification Information: Full name, date of
            birth, nationality, gender, signature, utility bills, photographs,
            phone number, home address, and/or email. - Formal Identification

            Driver's License, National Identity Card, State ID Card, Tax ID
            number, passport number, driver's license details, national identity
            card details, visa information, and/or any other information deemed
            necessary to comply with our legal obligations under financial or
            anti-money laundering laws. - Institutional Information: Employer
            Identification number (or comparable number issued by a government),
            proof of legal formation (e.g. Articles of Incorporation), personal
            identification information for all material beneficial owners. -
            Transaction Information: Information about the transactions you make
            on our Services, such as trading activity, account history, and
            wallet addresses. - Employment Information: Office location, job
            title, and/or description of role. Correspondence: Survey responses,
            information provided to our support team or user research team. -
            Online Identifiers: Geo location/tracking details, browser
            fingerprint, operating system, browser name and version, and/or
            personal IP addresses. - Cookies: Cookies are files with small
            amounts of data that are commonly used as anonymous unique
            identifiers. These are sent to your browser from the website that
            you visit and are stored on your computer's hard drive. Our website
            uses these “cookies” to collect information and to improve our
            platform. You have the option to either accept or refuse these
            cookies, and know when a cookie is being sent to your computer. If
            you choose to refuse our cookies, you may not be able to use some
            portions of our Service. We may collect the following types of
            information from Public Databases, Credit Bureaus and ID
            Verification Partners like Jumio: - Government records and publicly
            available information about you to verify you to comply with our
            legal obligations, such as anti-money laundering laws, and to assess
            risks about you to ensure our Services are not used fraudulently or
            for other illicit activities. - Public blockchain data to ensure
            parties utilizing our Services are not engaged in illegal or
            prohibited activity under our Terms, and to analyze transaction
            trends for research and development purposes.
          </p>
          <h4>3. ANONYMIZED AND AGGREGATED DATA</h4>
          <p>
            Except for this section, none of the other provisions of this
            Privacy Policy applies to anonymized or aggregated customer data
            (i.e., information about our customers that we combine together so
            that it no longer identifies or references an individual customer).
            Algoo Trading may use anonymized or aggregate customer data for any
            business purpose, including to better understand customer needs and
            behaviors, improve our Services, conduct business intelligence and
            marketing, and detect security threats. We may perform our own
            analytics on anonymized data or enable analytics provided by third
            parties. Types of data we may anonymize include transaction data,
            click-stream data, performance metrics, and fraud indicators.
          </p>
          <h4>4. HOW YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION IS USED</h4>
          <p>
            We generally use personal information to create, develop, operate,
            deliver, and improve our Services, content and advertising; and for
            loss prevention, anti-money laundering, and anti-fraud purposes.
            Most of our core Services are subject to laws and regulations
            requiring us to collect, use, and store your personal information in
            certain ways. This includes collection and storage of your photo
            identification. In addition, we use third parties to verify your
            identity by comparing the personal information you provide against
            third-party databases and public records. We have no choice but to
            actively monitor, investigate, prevent, and mitigate any potentially
            prohibited or illegal activities, enforce our agreements with third
            parties, and/or prevent and detect violations of our posted user
            agreement or agreements for other Services.
          </p>
          <p>
            We also simply cannot provide you with Services without such
            information. For example, we send administrative or account-related
            information to you to keep you updated about our Services, inform
            you of relevant security issues or updates, or provide other
            transaction-related information. Based on your communication
            preferences, we may send you marketing communications (e.g., emails
            or mobile notifications) to inform you about our events or our
            partner events; to deliver targeted marketing; and to provide you
            with promotional offers. Our marketing will be conducted in
            accordance with your advertising marketing preferences and as
            permitted by applicable law.
          </p>
          <h4>5. LEGAL BASES FOR PROCESSING YOUR INFORMATION</h4>
          <p>
            For individuals who are located in the European Economic Area, the
            United Kingdom or Switzerland (collectively “EEA Residents'') at the
            time their personal information is collected, our legal bases for
            processing your information under the EU General Data Protection
            Regulation (“GDPR”) will depend on the personal information at
            issue, the specific context in the which the personal information is
            collected and the purposes for which it is used. We generally only
            process your data where we are legally required to, where processing
            is necessary to perform any contracts, we entered with you (or to
            take steps at your request prior to entering into a contract with
            you), where processing is in our legitimate interests to operate our
            business and not overridden by your data protection interests or
            fundamental rights and freedoms, or where we have obtained your
            consent to do so. In some rare instances, we may need to process
            your personal information to protect your vital interests or those
            of another person.
          </p>
          <h4>6. HOW WE PROTECT AND STORE PERSONAL INFORMATION</h4>
          <p>
            We understand how important your privacy is, which is why Algoo
            Trading maintains (and contractually requires third parties it
            shares your information with to maintain) appropriate
            physical,technical and administrative safeguards to protect the
            security and confidentiality of the personal information you entrust
            to us.
          </p>
          <p>
            We may store and process all or part of your personal and
            transactional information in the US and elsewhere in the world where
            our facilities or our service providers are located. We protect your
            personal information by maintaining physical, electronic, and
            procedural safeguards in compliance with the applicable laws and
            regulations.
          </p>
          <p>
            We cannot guarantee that loss, misuse, unauthorized acquisition, or
            al teration of your data will not occur. Please recognize that you
            play a vital role in protecting your own personal information. When
            registering with our Services, it is important to choose a password
            of sufficient length and complexity, to not reveal this password to
            any third-parties, and to immediately notify us if you become aware
            of any unauthorized access to or use of your account.
          </p>
          <p>
            We also cannot ensure or warrant the security or confidentiality of
            information you transmit to us or receive from us by Internet or
            wireless connection, including email, phone, or SMS, since we have
            no way of protecting that information once it leaves and until it
            reaches us. If you have reason to believe that your data is no
            longer secure, please contact us using the contact information
            provided in the “How to contact us” section below.
          </p>
          <h4>7. RETENTION OF PERSONAL INFORMATION</h4>
          <p>
            We store your personal information securely throughout the life of
            your Algoo Trading Account. We will only retain your personal
            information for as long as necessary to fulfill the purposes for
            which we collected it, including for the purposes of satisfying any
            legal, accounting, or reporting obligations or to resolve disputes.
            While retention requirements vary by jurisdiction, information about
            our typical retention periods for different aspects of your personal
            information are described below.
          </p>
          <h4>9. CHILDREN'S PERSONAL INFORMATION</h4>
          <p>
            We do not knowingly request to collect personal information from any
            person under the age of 18. If a user submitting personal
            information is suspected of being younger than 18 years of age,
            Algoo Trading will require the user to close his or her account and
            will not allow the user to continue using our Services. We will also
            take steps to delete the information as soon as possible. Please
            notify us if you know of any individuals under the age of 18 using
            our Services so we can take action to prevent access to our
            Services.
          </p>
          <h4>10. Data transferred out of the EU</h4>
          <p>
            We rely primarily on the European Commission's Standard Contractual
            Clauses to facilitate the international and onward transfer of
            personal information collected in the European Economic Area
            (“EEA”), the United Kingdom and Switzerland (collectively “European
            Personal Information”), to the extent the recipients of the European
            Personal Information are located in a country that the EU considers
            to not provide an adequate level of data protection. We may also
            rely on an adequacy decision of the European Commission confirming
            an adequate level of data protection in the jurisdiction of the
            party receiving the information, or derogations in specific
            situations.
          </p>
          <h4>11. YOUR PRIVACY RIGHTS AND CHOICES</h4>
          <p>
            Depending on applicable law where you reside, you may be able to
            assert certain rights related to your personal information
            identified below. If any of the rights listed below are not provided
            under law for your operating entity or jurisdiction, Algoo Trading
            has absolute discretion in providing you with those rights.
          </p>
          <p>
            Your rights to personal information are not absolute. Depending upon
            the applicable law, access to your rights under the applicable law
            may be denied: (a) when denial of access is required or authorized
            by law; (b) when granting access would have a negative impact on
            another's privacy; (c) to protect our rights and properties; (d)
            where the request is frivolous or vexatious, or for other reasons.
          </p>
          <p>
            Access and portability. You may request that we provide you a copy
            of your personal information held by us. This information will be
            provided without undue delay subject to a potential fee associated
            with gathering of the information (as permitted by law), unless such
            provision adversely affects the rights and freedoms of others. In
            certain circumstances, you may request to receive your personal
            information in a structured, commonly used and machine-readable
            format, and to have us transfer your personal information directly
            to another data controller.
          </p>
          <p>
            Rectification of incomplete or inaccurate personal information. You
            may request us to rectify or update any of your personal information
            held by Algoo Trading that is inaccurate. You may request to erase
            your personal information, subject to applicable law. If you close
            your Algoo Trading Account, we will mark your account in our
            database as "Closed," but will keep certain account information,
            including your request to erase, in our database for a period of
            time as described above. This is necessary to deter fraud, by
            ensuring that persons who try to commit fraud will not be able to
            avoid detection simply by closing their account and opening a new
            account, and to comply with our legal obligations. However, if you
            close your account, your personal information will not be used by us
            for any further purposes, nor shared with third parties, except as
            necessary to prevent fraud and assist law enforcement, as required
            by law, or in accordance with this Privacy Policy. In some
            jurisdictions, applicable law may give you the right to restrict or
            object to us processing or transferring your personal information
            under certain circumstances. We may continue to process your
            personal information if it is necessary for the defense of legal
            claims, or for any other exceptions permitted by applicable law.
          </p>
          <p>
            To the extent we can rely on legitimate interest under the
            applicable law, we will only send you information about our Services
            that are similar to those which were the subject of a previous sale
            or negotiations of a sale to you. We will contact you by electronic
            means for marketing purposes only if you have consented to such
            communication. You may raise such objections with regard to initial
            or further processing for purposes of direct marketing at any time
            and free of charge.
