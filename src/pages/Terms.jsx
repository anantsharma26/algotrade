            Algoo Trading only allows cryptocurrency deposits at this time to
            conduct cryptocurrency trades outlined in the ‘TRADING’ section
            below. When Customer initiates a cryptocurrency deposit (a
            “Cryptocurrency Deposit”) into the Customer’s Account, Customer is
            solely responsible for executing the Cryptocurrency Deposit properly
            and accurately. Algoo Trading is not responsible for any
            Cryptocurrency until such time as such Cryptocurrency is
            successfully deposited into the relevant wallet address provided by
            Algoo Trading to Customer as evidenced by such deposit appearing on
            the relevant block explorer for such deposit. Algoo Trading is not
            responsible for any delay s, losses or fees in connection with a
            Cryptocurrency Deposit and is not obligated to assist or support
            Customer in any fashion with respect to an unsuccessful

            incomplete Cryptocurrency Deposit, including but not limited to,
            those deposits sent by Customer to a Cryptocurrency wallet
            designated by Algoo Trading for a different type of Cryptocurrency
            than the Cryptocurrency being sent by Customer, whether or not such
            deposit is evidenced on the blockchain. Algoo Trading does not
            guarantee that any such assistance will result in the successful
            completion or remediation of a Cryptocurrency Deposit or the
            recovery of any Cryptocurrency. Customer understands that a
            Cryptocurrency Deposit cannot be reversed once properly initiated.

            information you provide to us for the purpose of us providing Algoo
            Trading Services to you. This consent is not related to, and does
            not affect, any rights or obligations we or you have in accordance
            with data protection laws, privacy laws and regulations. You can
            withdraw your consent at any time by closing your account with us.

          <h4>CRYPTOCURRENCY RISK DISCLOSURES</h4>
          <p>
            Cryptocurrencies are highly speculative in nature, involve a high
            degree of risk and can rapidly and significantly decrease in value.
            It is reasonably possible for the value of Cryptocurrencies to
            decrease to zero or near zero. Cryptocurrency held on the Algoo
            Trading Platform is not protected by FDIC insurance or any other
            government-backed or third-party insurance. The future development
            of Cryptocurrencies and their underlying software protocols is
            uncertain. The slowing or stopping of the development or acceptance
            of Cryptocurrencies may negatively affect their value.
            Cryptocurrencies are not regulated or are lightly regulated in most
            countries, including Switzerland. However, one or more countries may
            take regulatory actions that could severely restrict the right to
            acquire, own, hold, sell or use Cryptocurrencies, which would
            adversely impact their value. Algoo Trading may be forced to suspend
            or discontinue the ability to purchase or sell Cryptocurrencies
            without notice. Technical and market factors outside of Algoo
            Trading’s control may adversely affect the value of
            Cryptocurrencies. These factors include, without limitation, (i)
            technical defects, limitations or changes to a given Cryptocurrency;
            (ii) Forks (as discussed in the User Agreement); and (iii) the
            emergence of competing Cryptocurrencies.
          </p>
          <h4>STORAGE</h4>
          <p>
            As part of your Algoo Trading Account, Algoo Trading will provide
            qualifying users access to store, track, transfer, and manage your
            balances of Digital Assets. As used throughout, " Digital Asset"
            means only those particular digital assets listed as available to
            trade or store in your Algoo Trading Account (also referred to as
            “Supported Digital Asset”). Services and supported assets may vary
            by jurisdiction, with no jurisdictions supported for fiat currency
            including the US Dollar, Euro, and GBP. We securely store Digital
            Asset private keys, which are used to process transactions, in a
            combination of online and offline storage. As a result of our
            security protocols, it may be necessary for us to retrieve private
            keys or related information from offline storage in order to
            facilitate Digital Asset Transfers in accordance with your
            instructions, and you acknowledge that this may delay the initiation
            or crediting of such Digital Asset Transfers.
          </p>
          <p>
            Your Algoo Trading Account is intended solely for proper use of
            Supported Digital Assets as designated on the Algoo Trading Site.
            Under no circumstances should you attempt to use your Algoo Trading
            Account to store, send, request, or receive any assets other than
            Supported Digital Assets. Algoo Trading assumes no responsibility in
            connection with any attempt to use your Algoo Trading Account with
            digital assets that we do not support. You acknowledge and agree
            that Algoo Trading is not liable for any unsupported digital asset
            that is sent to a wallet associated with your Algoo Trading Account.
            Algoo Trading may in its sole discretion terminate support for any
            particular Digital Asset. If you do not sell or send such Digital
            Asset off platform before Algoo Trading terminates its support for
            such Digital Asset, then Algoo Trading may, in its sole discretion,
            remove such digital asset from your Algoo Trading Account and credit
            your Algoo Trading Account the equivalent market value of a
            supported Digital Asset minus transaction costs.
          </p>
          <h4>TITLE</h4>
          <p>

            have good title thereto and that such wallet is owned and operated
            for your benefit, and no person or entity, has better rights, title,

            Trading. As the owner of Digital Assets in your Algoo Trading
            Account, you shall bear all risk of loss of such Digital Assets.
            Except as required by law, or except as provided herein, Algoo
            Trading will not sell, transfer, loan, hypothecate, or otherwise
            alienate Digital Assets in your Algoo Trading Account unless
            instructed by you.

            policies, you may withdraw your Digital Assets by sending it to a
            different blockchain address. As long as you continue to store your
            Digital Assets with Algoo Trading, Algoo Trading shall retain

          </p>
          <h4>BOTS</h4>
          <p>
            The Services may include the availability of trading algorithms or
            bots to help you automate trading strategies. A strategy can be as
            simple as buying a small amount of an asset over a period of time to
            more complex automations such as grid trading and portfolio
            rebalancing. which allow you to configure the parameters of the
            chosen bot (for example, DCA Bot, GRID Bot, etc.) that will execute
            cryptocurrency trade orders automatically on the Algoo Trading
            platform or third-party cryptocurrency exchanges within those
            established parameters and without the need for additional human
            interaction or intervention. The trading algorithms are provided by
            third-party users of the Services and not independently tested,
            approved, recommended, or guaranteed by Algoo Trading. You should
            take independent financial advice from a professional in connection
            with, or independently research and verify, any information that is
            provided by us of the third-parties that you wish to rely upon,
            whether for the purpose of making an investment decision or
            otherwise. Any content, data, information, or publications made
            available through the third parties in connection with use of the
            trading algorithms are furnished by us on an as-is basis for your
            convenience and information. Any opinions, advice, statements,
            services, offers, or other information made available by third
            parties are those of the respective author(s) or publisher(s), and

            approval by Algoo Trading of the content or information you may
            obtain from them. Algoo Trading has no control over the content or
            information of these resources and Algoo Trading disclaims any
            warranty or representation, either express or implied, that the
            information in such publications is accurate or complete. Past
            performances by the algorithms available to you are not an accurate
            predictor of future performance, and there are no guarantees that
            the algorithms will work under all market conditions. You represent

            The use of all Services is subject to a limit on the amount of
            volume you may transact or transfer in a given period, stated in
            U.S. Dollar terms. Your transaction limits may vary depending on
            your payment method, identity verification steps you have completed,
            and other factors. Algoo Trading reserves the right to change
            applicable limits as we deem necessary in our absolute and sole
            discretion. If you wish to raise your limits beyond the posted
            amounts, you may submit a request via the Algoo Trading Site or by
            contacting support@AlgooTrading.org. We may require you to submit
            additional information about yourself or your business, provide
            records, or arrange for meetings with Algoo Trading representatives.

          <h4>SITE ACCURACY NOT GUARANTEED</h4>
          <p>
            We make no representation or warranty that the Algoo Trading Site,
            or the server that makes it available, is free of viruses or errors,
            that its content is accurate, that it will be uninterrupted, or that
            defects will be corrected. We will not be responsible or liable to
            you for any loss of any kind, from action taken, or taken in
            reliance on content, material, or information contained on the Algoo
            Trading Site. Links to third-party materials may be provided as a
            convenience but are not controlled by us. You acknowledge and agree
            that we are not responsible for any aspect of the information,
            content, or services contained in any third-party materials or on
            any third-party sites accessible or linked to the Algoo Trading
            Site. You acknowledge that the prices displayed on the Algoo Trading
            Site are proprietary and not taken directly from any one source, and
            therefore may not match the prices that you see elsewhere (including
            prices quoted on certain exchanges or marketplaces). You further
            acknowledge that the triggering of your transaction is linked to the
            prices we quote on the Algoo Trading Site. We attempt to display
            prices on an ongoing basis and to have the currently applicable
            prices displayed on the Algoo Trading Site as quickly as possible,
            however, the market for cryptocurrency is extremely volatile and
            prices often change faster than communication speed, which could
            result in “stale” prices being displayed on the Algoo Trading Site.
            In addition, there will be times when circumstances beyond Algoo
            Trading’s control may prevent the Algoo Trading Site from displaying
            prices or otherwise impact the prices being displayed.
          </p>
          <h4>COMPLETED TRANSACTIONS</h4>
          <p>
            Algoo Trading will make reasonable efforts to accept trades or
            transactions, but we are under no obligation whatsoever to accept
            any specific transaction or order, and may discontinue services in
            our sole discretion in accordance with this Agreement. You cannot
            cancel, reverse, or change any transaction marked as complete or
            pending. You are responsible for maintaining an adequate balance
            and/or sufficient credit limits in order to avoid overdraft,
            insufficient funds, or similar fees charged by your payment
            provider. Algoo Trading reserves the right to refuse to process, or
            to cancel or reverse, any purchases or sales, or any applicable
            transactions or payments, in its sole discretion, even after funds
            have been credited to or debited from your account(s), under the
            following circumstances: (a) if the transaction, in our absolute and
            sole discretion, constitutes an abusive use of the platform; (b)
            involves an error with respect to price, quantity, or other
            parameters; (c) is required by law or if Algoo Trading suspects the
            transaction involves or potentially involved (or has a high risk of
            involvement in) restricted businesses as described in Section 8 of
            this Agreement, money laundering, terrorist financing, fraud, or any
            other type of financial crime; (d) in response to a subpoena, court
            order, or other government order. In such instances, Algoo Trading
            may reverse, cancel, or refuse to process the payment or transaction
            and we are under no obligation to allow you to reinstate a purchase
            or sale order at the same price or on the same terms as the reversed
            or canceled transaction and you hereby release us from all liability
            in relation to any action taken by us under this section.
          </p>
          <h4>TAXES</h4>
          <p>
            It is your sole responsibility to determine whether, and to what
            extent, any taxes apply to any transactions you conduct through the
            Services, and to withhold, collect, report and remit the correct
            amounts of taxes to the appropriate tax authorities. Algoo Trading
            does not deduct any amount for taxes when you enter into a
            transaction, and you are solely responsible for all tax returns and
            payments required to be filed with or made to any federal, state, or
            local tax authority in any nation with respect to any such
            transaction. All amounts set out, or expressed to be payable
            hereunder by you to Algoo Trading, shall be deemed to be exclusive
            of any value added tax (“VAT”). If VAT is chargeable, you shall pay
            to Algoo Trading an amount equal to such VAT.
          </p>
          <h4>REWARDS</h4>
          <p>
            Customer may elect to participate in the Algoo Trading Rewards
            Program (the “Rewards Program”), which provides rewards for what is
            commonly known as “staking”, which allows Customer to earn
            additional Cryptocurrency of the same kind of Cryptocurrency held in
            Customer's Account. The terms and conditions governing the Rewards
            Program are as follows: Each Customer participating in the Rewards
            Program agrees to allow Algoo Trading to rehypothecate the
            Customer’s Cryptocurrency held in such Customer Account to the
            extent that Customer wishes to stake their Cryptocurrency. Such
            consent to rehypothecate expressly includes allowing Algoo Trading
            to (1) stake Cryptocurrency held in an omnibus fashion through
            various blockchain protocols; and (2) lend such Cryptocurrency to
            various institutional third parties (each, a “Borrower”) determined
            at Algoo Trading’s sole discretion (each, a “Loan”). Algoo Trading
            enters into these Loans as principal and independently negotiates
            with each Borrower the terms of a Loan, but these Loans are
            generally unsecured, for a fixed term of less than one year or can
            be repaid on a demand basis, and provide a fee payable in
            Cryptocurrency based on the percentage and denominated in the
            Cryptocurrency lent. Algoo Trading selects which Cryptocurrencies
            are available for such staking and lending at its sole discretion,
            subject to limitations on amounts allowable and additional terms and
            conditions. Algoo Trading will typically publish anticipated reward
            rates once per month on or before the first business day of each
            month. Reward rates may be tiered, with specified rates in effect at
            any time only applied to specified portions of amounts of
            Cryptocurrency held in the Account. Rewards will be payable in
            arrears and added to the Account on or before the fifth business day
            of each calendar month for the prior calendar month. Algoo Trading
            uses the daily balance method to calculate the Rewards on the
            Account. This method applies a daily periodic rate to the specified
            principal in the Account each day. The daily periodic rate is
            calculated by dividing the applicable interest rate by three hundred
            sixty-five (365) days, even in leap years. Algoo Trading will
            determine the Reward rates and tiers for each month in Algoo
            Trading’s sole discretion, and Customer acknowledges that such
            Rewards may not be equivalent to benchmark interest rates observed
            in the market for bank deposit accounts. Rewards will be credited to
            the Account within five (5) business days following the end of each
            calendar month. The Account must be open on such date in order to
            receive this payment of Rewards. All Rewards will be paid in
            Cryptocurrency. Once Rewards have been credited to the Account,
            Customer may earn Rewards on such Cryptocurrency in future months.
            Rewards will be paid in kind (i.e., in the type of Cryptocurrency
            that is held in the Account). Customer may request a Withdrawal at
            any time, consistent with the mechanics outlined in Section 6 below.
            However, for Customers in the Rewards Program, Withdrawals may be
            delayed, or in some instances subject to partial completion.
            Customer understands and acknowledges that Customer may only be able
            to earn Rewards to the extent that Customer satisfies certain
            minimum Cryptocurrency balance requirements (“Minimum Balance”).
            Algoo Trading will publish Minimum Balance details on the Platform.
            Minimum Balance details are subject to change at any time. If a
            Withdrawal results in a particular Cryptocurrency balance in
            Customer’s Account falling below a Minimum Balance, then Customer
            will not earn Rewards with respect to such Cryptocurrency. REWARDS
            PROGRAM RISKS. Participating in the Rewards Program may put
            Customer's Cryptocurrency at risk as loans made by Algoo Trading may
            not be secured. Customer may opt-out of the Rewards Program at any
            time by doing so on the Algoo Trading site.
          </p>
          <h4>WITHDRAWALS</h4>
          <p>
            Customer may arrange to withdraw and transfer Cryptocurrency in the
            Account to an external wallet (such process, a “Withdrawal”). Algoo
            Trading will effectuate a Withdrawal based upon Customer’s written
            instructions; provided that Customer understands and agrees that
            Algoo Trading may, in its sole discretion, delay, modify or
            prohibit, in whole or in part, any requested Withdrawal, including
            in instances where: (a) Algoo Trading believes such action is
            prudent in order to satisfy Algoo Trading’s anti-money laundering
            obligations, (b) Algoo Trading suspects that the Customer, the
            wallet address, or the Withdrawal itself are connected to,
            associated with, or being used in furtherance of potential fraud,
            (c) Customer is in violation of the Customer Agreement, (d) the
            Withdrawal is being attempted within thirty (30) days of a deposit
            of Cryptocurrency into the Account, or (e) outstanding fees are
            associated with the Account or the Account would, after the
            Withdrawal, have an insufficient balance to cover actual or
            anticipated fees. Customer understands that, once initiated on the
            network associated with the Cryptocurrency subject to the
            Withdrawal, a Withdrawal will typically be processed at the speed of
            such network, but that in certain situations, a Withdrawal may be
            delayed in connection with any latency, congestion, disruption, or
            other delay of such network. Customer understands that Algoo Trading
            cannot reverse a Withdrawal that has been broadcast to a
            Cryptocurrency network. Customer also understands that Algoo Trading
            reserves the right to cancel any pending Withdrawal as required by
            law or in response to a subpoena, court order, or other binding
            government order. Customer understands that they are exclusively
            responsible for ensuring that a Withdrawal is being made to the
            correct or intended wallet address. Withdrawals cannot be reversed
            once broadcast to the relevant Cryptocurrency network. Algoo Trading
            will not be liable for any loss that results from inaccurate,
            incomplete, or misleading details that Customer may provide in
            connection with a Withdrawal. Algoo Trading will not bear any
            liability for any failure, error or delay in processing a
            Withdrawal. Algoo Trading may, in its sole discretion, provide
            reasonable assistance to Customer in the event that a customer
            requests reasonable assistance in connection with an attempted,
            failed, or otherwise erroneous Withdrawal. Algoo Trading does not
            guarantee that any such assistance will result in the successful
            completion or remediation of a Withdrawal or the recovery of any
            Cryptocurrency. Algoo Trading may charge fees in connection with any
            such assistance. Customer understands that a Withdrawal cannot be
            reversed once properly initiated.

          <h4>ASSUMPTION OF RISK</h4>
          <p>
            You acknowledge that there are risks associated with using the
            Services and the Algoo Trading Site, including but not limited to
            risk that the underlying protocols of supported networks undergo
            material changes to their operating rules, risk of failure of
            hardware, software and Internet connections, the risk of malicious
            software introduction, and the risk that third-parties may obtain
            unauthorized access to information stored within your Algoo Trading
            Account. As such, Algoo Trading will not be responsible or liable to
            you for any such related losses and takes no responsibility for use
            of the Services that involves user error such as forgotten
            passwords, incorrectly construed transactions, or mistyped wallet
            addresses; server failure or data loss; corrupt files; unauthorized
            access, or; any unauthorized third-party activities, including
            without limitation the use or introduction of computer viruses, or
            other malware, phishing, spoofing or other means of attack against
            you or the Algoo Trading Site or Services. You further accept and
            acknowledge that Algoo Trading will not be responsible for any
            communication failures, disruptions, errors, distortions or delays
            you may experience when using the Algoo Trading Site or the
            Services, regardless of the cause. Cryptocurrency is not covered by
            any insurance, including insurance offered by the Swiss Financial
            Market Supervisory Authority (FINMA). You agree and understand that
            the underlying protocols of supported cryptocurrency networks are
            subject to changes in operating rules or other valid operational
            protocol (a so-called “Fork”) that may result in more than one
            version (each, a “Forked Network”) and Algoo Trading holding an
            identical amount of cryptocurrency associated with each Forked
            Network. You further agree and understand that Forks may materially
            affect the value, function, and/or name of the cryptocurrency you
            may have with Algoo Trading. In the event of a Fork, you agree and
            understand that Algoo Trading may temporarily suspend our operations
            (with or without advance notice to you) while we choose, in our sole
            and absolute discretion, which Forked Networks to support. You agree
            and understand that in our best estimation we are unlikely to
            support most Forked Networks and that the cryptocurrency of most
            Forked Networks will likely not be made available to you. Algoo
            Trading makes no guarantees or recommendations of any kind, nor does
            it purport to offer any investment advice of any kind. The risk of
            complete loss in trading or holding any type of cryptocurrency can
            be substantial and is likely. You are solely responsible for
            evaluating the merits and risks associated with the use of the Algoo
            Trading Site and the Services and should take into consideration
            your particular financial situation in determining whether using the
            Services or trading cryptocurrencies is suitable for you. You hereby
            represent that your Algoo Trading Account is completely
            discretionary in nature, and is not being used primarily for
            personal, family, or household purposes. No Investment Advice or

            strategy or related transaction is appropriate for you based on your
            personal investment objectives, financial circumstances and risk
            tolerance. Algoo Trading may provide educational information about

            responsible for any trade placed through, originating from, or
            associated with the Account whether placed by Customer or another
            third-party as a result of Customer’s failure to safeguard the login
            credentials. Customer represents that all orders entered by Customer
            through the Account are unsolicited and based upon Customer’s
            decisions. Customer understands that ALGOO STRA TEGIES, together

            and agrees that under no circumstances will Customer’s use of the
            Platform or Account be deemed to create a relationship that includes
            the provision of or tendering of investment advice. To the extent
            that research materials or similar information is made available
            through the Platform, the Customer understands that these materials
            are intended for information and educational purposes only and they
            do not constitute a recommendation to enter into any transactions or
            to engage in any investment strategies. Customer represents and
            warrants to Algoo Trading that Customer is not: (a) located in,
            under the control of, or a national or resident of any country to
            which Switzerland has embargoed goods or services, (b) identified as
            a “Specially Designated National,” (c) placed on the Federal

            ability to conduct business with Customer. Customer further
            represents and warrants that Customer will not use the Platform if
            the laws of Customer’s country or jurisdiction prohibit Customer
            from doing so in accordance with this Agreement. Customer: (i)
            certifies that the information contained in this Agreement, the
            Account application, and any other document that Customer furnishes
            to Algoo Trading in connection with the Account is complete, true,
            and correct; (ii) authorizes Algoo Trading to contact any individual
            or firm noted on documents provided to Algoo Trading; (iii)

            Customer Agreement, the Account application, and any other document
            Customer furnishes in connection with the Account is Algoo Trading’s
            property. Customer shall promptly advise Algoo Trading of any
            changes to the information in such agreements and documents in
            writing within ten (10) calendar days. Algoo Trading may retain this
            Customer Agreement, the Account application, and all other such
            documents and their respective records at Algoo Trading’s sole
            discretion. Customer understands that Algoo Trading may take steps
            to verify the accuracy of the information Customer provides to Algoo
            Trading in the Algoo Trading Account application or otherwise,
            including by directly or indirectly making any inquiries Algoo
            Trading considers necessary to verify Customer identity or protect
            against fraud and that Algoo Trading may restrict Customer access to
            the Account or take other action Algoo Trading reasonab ly deems
            necessary pending such verification. The Customer understands that
            all investments involve risk, that losses may exceed the principal
            invested, and that the past performance of a Cryptocurrency,
            industry, sector, market, or financial product does not guarantee
            future results or returns. Customer further understands that there
            are risks associated with utilizing an internet-based trading system
            including, without limitation, the failure of hardware, software and

            regulations. Algoo Trading is not available in all jurisdictions.
            Customer agrees to refrain from using the Service if Customer begins
            to reside in a jurisdiction where the Service would violate any of
            the laws and regulations of such jurisdiction. Customer will not
            provide incorrect information about Customer’s address, residency or
            domicile and will immediately inform Algoo Trading if there is any
            change to previously provided information. Customer understands that
            neither the Customer Agreement or any other document or
            communication received from Algoo Trading shall be construed as
            providing any legal, accounting, estate, actuary, or tax advice.
            Customer agrees to review publicly available information regarding
            the Customer’s positions in the Account, Account statements and
            Trade Confirmations. Customer must rely upon its own
            representatives, including its own legal counsel and accountant, as
            to legal, tax and related matters concerning any of Customer’s
            activities with respect to the Account, including any assets or
            transactions in the Account and for preparation of any legal,
            accounting or tax documents.

            including but not limited to, where: (a) Algoo Trading believes such

            against it (the “Algoo Trading Hold Purposes”). (B) Termination by
            Algoo Trading. Customer agrees that, without notice, Algoo Trading

            Customer must provide Algoo Trading with transfer instructions,
            together with all other information that Algoo Trading may
            reasonably request, in order to transfer any remaining

            termination or cancellation of the Account, Customer hereby agrees
            that Algoo Trading is permitted to sell any remaining Cryptocurrency
            on the open market at the prevailing market price and return the
